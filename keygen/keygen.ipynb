    "You are given a task to develop a simple keygen which require a two dimensional matrix with a size of N x N as an input, where N is an odd number between 3 and 9.\n",
    "The matrix will be filled with integer numbers ranging between 0 and 49.\n",
    "The following figure illustrates the input matrix with the size of 3 x 3.\n",

    "![matrix](./img/matrix.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected output will be a key consist of 6 digits.\n",
    "The first 3 digits could be generated by calculating the difference between the sum of its diagonals; or in other words the difference between the sum of D1 and the sum of D2.\n",
    "The last 3 digits could be generated by calculating the difference between the sum of its crosses; or in other words the difference between the sum of C1 and the sum of C2."
